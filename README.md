Instructions for the user:
  - Open each file in the STM IDE and Debug 
  
  Task 1:
    - Debug, open memory browser and run to view changes to the string
    
  Task 2:
    - Run each program, the LEDs will confirm what is executed in each task
    - Refer to flow diagrams module for ease of explaination
    
  Task 3:
    - To be completed by Jason and Kevin 
   
  Task 4:
    - Run each program
    - It is to be noted that task a, b and c can all be done in one program as we are running our timers in hardware by checking flags to operate the delay time
    also the equation in part a used takes in the input time and toggles how long the prescaler is such that a and b are the same.
