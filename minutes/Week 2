Started with a quick intro to git from khit and jason

Began reading assignment spec. 

Ari delegated that Jason and Kevin should work on digital I/O and get a head start on it and ask any questions to khit and jesse if needed. 

Ari and Viswada would work on task 1 with ari and her starting task a, b and c. 

The intro to git took a long time with our lab so we quickly delegated and began with our tasks.
