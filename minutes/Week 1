Eveyone got to know each other, we all had a good break 

Everyone just worked through the LAB book helping each other where needed.

We started with our first ASM project getting to know how to use the debugger and how to nabiagte the ide.

We also wrote our first code. 

We established that Ari will delegate tasks among our team and keep minutes of each meeting.
